# Vulkan Tutorial Application

This is a simple Vulkan Tutorial application, based on original [Vulkan tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com). All steps up to Texture mapping were completed.

This project is just a toy example used to learn Vulkan. Some functions are slightly different from the tutorial, however, the general structure is the same.

## Dependencies

* glm
* GLFW
* stb_image (included here)
